# Project Structure Guide

This project is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server built with Node.js and TypeScript. It uses the [`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`](mdc:package.json) dependency to provide MCP server functionality.

The main files and directories are:

- [package.json](mdc:package.json): Contains project metadata, scripts, and dependencies, including the MCP SDK.
- [package-lock.json](mdc:package-lock.json): Automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules directory, or any of the project's dependencies.
- [src/index.ts](mdc:src/index.ts): Intended as the main entry point for the MCP server setup. (Currently empty)

All source code should be placed in the `src/` directory.
